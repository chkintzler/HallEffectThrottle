Using the Arduino framework and Teensy hardware this project employs 7 ratiometric hall effect sensors to achieve millimeter accuracy and absolute position. With a single cylindrical magnet attached under the handle, each hall effect sensor measures the strength of the magnetic field. A simple algorithm is used to select the most relevant sensor and calculate the throttle position. Along with a rotary encoder and extra button for use in flight simulator software.![frontView](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4db92e42-f203-4cea-819e-578d254958a4)
